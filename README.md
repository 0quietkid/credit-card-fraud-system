The code contains a prediction system which learns from a dataset from kaggle about transactions history of customers from a European bank which ultimately holds where the said transaction was a fraud case or not. The code visually show how many of the non fraud to fraud cases there were and then my model shows how it predicted if the case was a fraud or not then shows itself how accuracte it was compared to the dataset with all true ,false positives and true, false negatives. A random forest classifier has been chosen to make preicitions after all the necessary modules were imported data was seen and understood to make predictions and now to make productions on new cases we can just upload the csv file or just add new row in the code then ask it to predict on it.
